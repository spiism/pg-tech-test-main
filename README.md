## Techincal Planning
***A React app will be developed to allow users to upload files and list all the uploaded files.
– create upload files service provides methods to save File and get Files using Axios.
– http-common.js initializes Axios with HTTP base Url and headers
– get file information (ex.date uploaded from the server)
***A .Net Core API will be available to be consumed by the React App.
– Configure Port for React File Upload App
***The API can use an in-memory database.
– REST API using InMemory Database in ASP.NET Core
